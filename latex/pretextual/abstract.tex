\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
    Data Structures is a discipline often associated with high cognitive load and,
    consequently, high failure and dropout rates, mainly due to the abstract nature
    of its concepts and the low motivation reported by students
    \cite{mtaho2024difficulties}. In this context, this work proposes an
    alternative to traditional teaching through the development of a serious game
    \cite{mouaheb2012serious}, designed to teach and reinforce educational content
    in a playful way. The game was created using the ENgAGED development
    methodology \cite{battistella2016engaged}, combined with the instructional
    strategy of Game-Based Learning (GBL) \cite{coffey2009digital}.

    As a result, a prototype was developed that is capable of implicitly
    representing fundamental data structure concepts, such as stacks, queues, and
    linked lists, integrating them into its game mechanics. The prototype was
    evaluated by students of Systems Analysis and Development and related fields,
    as well as by some participants without prior knowledge in the area, using an
    adapted version of the MEEGA+ evaluation model \cite{meega2020}. The findings
    indicate that the game demonstrates good usability, provides a positive player
    experience, and effectively conveys the intended content, although some issues
    were identified regarding the randomness system (RNG) in the core mechanic and
    the need for a more guided tutorial.
