**Legend:**

* **X:** Indicates work is being performed during that month.

**Note:** This is a sample Gantt chart.  You'll need to adjust the timeline and tasks based on your specific project requirements, chosen game engine, complexity of data structures implemented, and your own work pace.  Remember to factor in time for unforeseen issues and potential delays.  Regularly review and update this chart throughout the project.
