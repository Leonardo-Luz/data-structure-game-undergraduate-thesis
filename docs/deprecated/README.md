## Description

This project aims to create an educational game that facilitates learning data structure concepts in a fun and engaging way.  Players will learn about various data structures through gameplay mechanics and progressively challenging levels that incorporate alchemical themes.

## Technologies

* **Game Engine:** Unity

## Features

* **Engaging Story:** A compelling narrative follows an alchemist recovering their lost bags.
* **Parallax Backgrounds:** Enhance visual appeal and immersion.
* **Progressive Difficulty:** Levels introduce new data structures and mechanics gradually.
* **Combat System:**  Enemies have weaknesses exploitable using crafted elements.
* **Item Combinations:** Players combine elements to create new ones, showcasing data structure operations.
* **Visualizations:** Sorting algorithms and other data structure operations are visually represented.

## Gameplay

**Story:** The alchemist awakens after an accident, their bags stolen.  They must use a damaged bag and newly-created elements to fight enemies and recover their lost research and bags, each bag introducing a new data structure.

**Core Mechanics:**

* **Element Creation:** The alchemist automatically generates elements at intervals.
* **Inventory Management:**  Inventories (initially a single slot, then a stack, queue, etc.) manage collected elements.
* **Combat:** Enemies are defeated by using elements that exploit their weaknesses.
* **Combos:** Combining elements in specific orders creates powerful effects.

## Level Design

All details about each level can be found [HERE](./docs/_notes/LEVELS.md)

The game features a series of levels, presenting differents data structure and searching/sorting algorithms:

**Early Levels (Tutorials):**

* **Level 1 (Basics):** Introduces movement, interaction, and basic combat. Single-slot inventory.
* **Level 2 (Stack & Combos):** Introduces stack mechanics (LIFO) and item combo effects. 5-slot stack inventory.
* **Level 3 (Sorting):** Introduces sorting algorithms using consumables.  Visual representation of sorting process.

**Intermediate Levels:**

* **Level 4 (Queue & Multiple Inventories):** Introduces queues (FIFO) and managing multiple inventories.
* **Level 5 (Boss Fight - Stack/Queue):** A boss fight using stack and queue mechanics.

**Advanced Levels:**

* **Level 6 (Searching):** Introduces searching algorithms.
* **Level 7 (Linked List):** Introduces linked lists.
* **Level 8 (Boss Fight - Linked List):** A boss fight using linked list mechanics.

**Post-Game Levels:**

* **Level 9 (Double Linked List):**
* **Level 10 (Binary Tree):**
* **Arena Mode:** An endless mode challenging the player with increasingly difficult scenarios incorporating all learned data structures.

## Research Book

All details about the Research Book can be found [HERE](./docs/_notes/RESEARCH.md)

Contains the notes of the alchemist, element descriptions, damage values, and combination tutorials.  Unknown combinations are displayed as "???".

## Combinations

All details about the Combinations can be found [HERE](./docs/_notes/COMBINATIONS.md)

## Concept Arts

* These arts can be changed

## Prototyping

* WIP

## Future Considerations

* Add more complex data structures (graphs, trees, hash tables)
* Implement difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Integrate a scoring system and leaderboards
* Add more diverse game mechanics and challenges

This README will be updated regularly to reflect the project's progress.
