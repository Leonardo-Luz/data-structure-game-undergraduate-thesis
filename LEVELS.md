* **Inventory:** 1 slot.
* **Objective:** Introduces basic movement, interaction, cast time, and damage mechanics.

* **Controls:**
    * A/Left Arrow: Move left
    * D/Right Arrow: Move right

**Level 2: Stack & Combos Tutorial**

* **Inventory:** Stack with a capacity of 5 items.
* **Objective:** Teaches stack mechanics (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out) and item combo effects.

**Level 3: Sort Consumables Tutorial**

* **Objective:** Introduces sorting algorithms through the use of consumables.
* **Mechanics:** Players use consumables (e.g., 'c' + inventory number) to sort elements based on their properties.  A visual representation of the sorting process will be displayed when consumables are used to showcase the chosen sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort or similar).

**Level 4: Queue & Multiple Inventory Tutorial**
