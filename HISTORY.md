## History

The character is a alchemist that lost his bags and all he could found was a damaged bag,
he can produce some elements from time to time and can use them to defend himself.
his objective is to recover the bags and finish his research.

**START AMBIENTATION:** alchemist fainted in the ground in the middle of a forest, a wagon wreckage by his right.
the alchemist wakes up.

**FIRST DIALOGUE**: What happened here... i can't remember almost anything... wait... MY BAGS. WHERE ARE MY MAGICAL BAGS.

**DIALOGUE: Pass through wagon wreckage:** maybe my bags and research can still be inside that wagon.

**DIALOGUE: interact with wagon:** my research is here but most of the pages are damaged, seems like i will need to start over...My bags seem to be missing too, probaly the same thing that did this to the wagon stole and damaged my items... they left behind a damaged bag.

**DIALOGUE: Found damaged magical bag:** this can be usefull for i while. maybe i can store a element here, but only one... i still need the rest of my bags to complete my research, some monster might have stolen them.

**POPUP: element fabrication:** each x seconds the alchemist will make a new element, if the bag is full the production will stop.

**DIALOGUE: Found first enemy: (red slime, weakness: fire)** maybe i could use some of my elements to defeat it.

**POPUP: combat mechanics:** each enemy has it owns weaknesses and health points...

**MESSAGE: Uses Wrong element:** it seems to be weak to fire.

**found the stack bag dialogue**: Now that i have a bigger bag i can mix some elements. pop combination tutorial.
